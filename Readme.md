A Django MVC Blog For the Rhythm Section Community

## Introduction

This project began as a tutorial for the purpose of a hands-on learning experience with Django-Python and PyCharm.
As I got further into the tutorial, and felt as though I had a good grasp on how Django flowed and operated, the project
began to morph into this Blog.
